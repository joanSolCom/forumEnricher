In 1963, President John F. Kennedy's administration ordered the U.S. Army's 2nd Infantry Division from Ft. Benning, Georgia to be prepared to enforce the racial integration of the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa. In a vain attempt to halt the enrollment of black students Vivian Malone and James Hood, Governor Wallace stood in front of Foster Auditorium at the University of Alabama on June 11, 1963. This became known as the \"Stand in the Schoolhouse Door\".[17] In September 1963, Wallace attempted to stop four black students from enrolling in four separate elementary schools in Huntsville. After intervention by a federal court in Birmingham, the four children were allowed to enter on September 9, becoming the first to integrate a primary or secondary school in Alabama.[18][19] Wallace desperately wanted to preserve segregation.

Workers sitting there at \"smoko\" and one says \"I heard on the radio yesterday that the Nazis White Supremacists completely incinerate human bodies in the ground with petrol!!\" and no informed White people listening retorting with facts and information like \"Sure, let's go burn a dead pig in the ground and see how we go using petrol!!\", but in the same mannerisms that posters use on Stormfront - No Profanity, No Racial Epithets, etcetera..... * White Nationalists and White National Socialist viciously bickering over trivial finer points of White Government policies and thus dividing White people further.

If your home was broken into, it was the responsibility of the homeowner to hold the suspect at gunpoint until the police arrived and arrested him. This worked very well for a long time.

Then again, \"Gun Control\" may just be a term for \"White Control\" since in this area anyway, about the only folk observing gun laws are White! Although I'm not that active at the moment I belong to a local Gun Club and White People are about all you see at both the shooting range and in the classes. The use of the range itself is inexpensive and some of the basic classes are even free. They are open to all, members and non-members, as are all the local ranges except on \"exclusive\" club in a near-by area know for its snootiness. Yet even in such a diverse area as Phoenix, I have seen only one black and maybe a handful of Mexicans at a local range. There are a number of ways to interpret this but to me what it says is that, as a whole, White gun enthusiasts chose to shoot responsibly and to learn what they can about the care and use of their weapons. On the other hand, there is a definite problem in this area with both drive-by shootings and gunfire at parties and other gatherings. If you take the time to check, at least 90% of this latter type of gun crime involves Blacks or \"Hispanics.\" Recently there also have been a number of shootings that also involve radical Muslims. Yes, indeed, \"Gun Control\" is a great slogan for Liberal Politicians, but the politicians as well as anyone with sense knows that laws are only effective when they can be observed and enforced. In other words, let's get real about this.

Any White nationalists that live in Jewmerica have a duty to relearn their native culture, and return to their respective motherlands, no matter how hopeless the situation there looks.

As I have mentioned previously in this thread, I can walk the streets at night and the early hours of the morning and pretty much know that the odds of other people walking past me whipping out a semi-automatic rifle on me is soooo remote, that I can safely say it is not going to happen. My street smarts allow me to steer clear of obvious situations. If it comes to my house, I have enough to take care of that, but I do not need a semi-automatic weapon. I only need enough firepower to defend myself, and not to take out the Australian Government. The PLE application is the best solution for White Nationalists. https://www.stormfront.org/forum/f65/ It is more likely that a truck will run me over, as Adamant pointed out earlier in this thread, However, that could happen anywhere in the world that has trucks. The problem with the 2nd amendment, that I observe, is it gives the right to non-whites to carry those same types of weapons. The statement \"Gun control is white people control\" is systemic under the same application for \"Gun control is non-white people control\". As I have also pointed out, I am not in control, and have never been in control of the Government, or Australia. Tyrannical, or not. I am subject to the laws of the Government of the day, just the same as anyone else in this country, but I own my property outright, so I can own guns with a permit, but not military weapons, because civilians in Australia simply do not need military style weapons. Civilians can own certain types of guns here in Australia. Civilians are civilians, law enforcers are law enforcers, and the military are military. Turning that order around creates a state of chaos. I advocate law and order, and I am an advocate of limited gun ownership for civilians, but not military grade guns, otherwise the law enforcers need bigger and better weapons.....then where does it stop.....tanks and rocket launchers for civilians?

Is this scenario truly okay with you? This scenario is not okay with me and it's not far fetched from today's globalist zog cabal reality we face as Whites. I am glad and grateful that America still has our first and second amendment laws and culture because of people like you. We Americans actively exercise our rights to remind the government that they do not possess control over our inalienable rights - at least a good portion of us do. I don't mean that to be offensive or cruel toward you. Countries under British rule don't seem to understand the importance of those inalienable freedoms and just how precious they are. Once those rights are gone, and you allow the forfeit, you have allowed for your own demise. Forgive me if I blanket statement the Brits' beliefs as it isn't my intention to blanket statement the free thinkers under British rule. If the government, which isn't to be trusted by any stretch of the imagination and regardless of which country you reside, has rockets, tanks, semi-automatic weapons etc., then it is only fair that a freedom-based populace be allowed to choose which weapon they possess to counter-regulate the regime. There is a balance structure in every society to preserve the rights and freedoms of man - especially the white man.

The only thing standing in the way is the People who have the freedom to free speech and weapons to protect said human rights as speech and other freedoms. The current state of affairs is too close for comfort. I will also add that the (((globalist jewish))) cabal systems currently in place does, and will continue to provide, unlimited weaponry of all sorts to the third world countries as they invade our lands, steal our wealth and destroy our culture. All the while (((they))) attempt to ban freedom-loving Whites from said weaponry as a means of self preservation. This is not only a direct threat to WNs, this is a perfect example of providing weapons to non-Whites to militarize and terrorize other White nations and third world nations. Again, a sad state of affairs but the current reality. (e.g., Fast & Furious and Iran-Contra) I simply do not and cannot comprehend why some, including those of other nations, refuse or deny to recognize the immediate threat or necessity to bear arms as a means of self preservation - whether it be semi-automatic or automatic weapons. Similarly, I can't comprehend why some would trust the globalist government over their own law-abiding White neighbors, if they should choose to not carry, who will likely be the ones to protect the masses in the event of tyranny and crime. Australian history, Irish history, German history, etc., are all perfect examples of why one should bear arms. The inception of the United Nations, formed in 1945, should have been the awakening for ALL Whites around the globe to procure and protect their land, families, and inalienable right to defend themselves, by means of bearing any and all arms necessary, against the very tyranny which has become a direct threat to White nations and the world today. Every single country under strict gun control laws, or abolished guns altogether, has coerced its own demise through totalitarian governing rule. With that said, with what you've said in an earlier post, and with what ADAMANT has said for days on this topic, I fail to comprehend how @SBWPWW adamantly refuses to absorb and recognize the legitimacy of even a minor percentage of the facts imposed without emotional responses.

If you are not in control of your own country in Australia, do you feel placated by the safety the state provides - even if that \"safety\" is provided by non-white tyrannical government police? Is this scenario truly okay with you? This scenario is not okay with me and it's not far fetched from today's globalist zog cabal reality we face as Whites. I am glad and grateful that America still has our first and second amendment laws and culture because of people like you. We Americans actively exercise our rights to remind the government that they do not possess control over our inalienable rights - at least a good portion of us do. I don't mean that to be offensive or cruel toward you. Countries under British rule don't seem to understand the importance of those inalienable freedoms and just how precious they are. Once those rights are gone, and you allow the forfeit, you have allowed for your own demise. Forgive me if I blanket statement the Brits' beliefs as it isn't my intention to blanket statement the free thinkers under British rule. If the government, which isn't to be trusted by any stretch of the imagination and regardless of which country you reside, has rockets, tanks, semi-automatic weapons etc., then it is only fair that a freedom-based populace be allowed to choose which weapon they possess to counter-regulate the regime. There is a balance structure in every society to preserve the rights and freedoms of man - especially the white man. Also, I feel I asked a relevant question, a few posts up, which contained a relevant and credible point. Could you offer your answer, without emotion and opinions, to my relevant question, please? Me: If automatic weapons or semi-automatic weapons became regulated by governments and measured to prevent law abiding citizens to possess, it would still never prevent a criminal from obtaining said weaponry. Wouldn't you rather have said automatic weapons or semi-automatic weapons in the hands of a law abiding citizen who would more likely be the hero to protect YOU from government tyranny and criminals? Originally Posted by Ocaena @SBWPWW - I would like to bring up one more point to impose a question. Could you also explain, without emotion and opinion, this: In the sad scenario that semi-automatic weapons and/or automatic weapons were made to be illegal - What is to say that criminals or government tyrants would not find a way to buy or possess said weaponry underground which would enable more crime in a society that had chose to ban certain weapons? Honest question.

If SBWPWW is \"fortunate\" enough to live to see the future Sino-Australian nation, I trust he will find it to his liking. It no doubt will be quite safe, except possibly for the occasional crazed knife-wielding chinaman. The main thing is NOT TO RESIST what is happening to us, aside from posting on the internet or printing out the odd flier or two. We are a polite, civilized people who will smile at our \"new neighbors\" and welcome them with open arms into our lands. After all, as the history of the past century shows, isn't that the \" white \" thing to do?", "idFile": "t1228707", "user": "SBWPWW", "date": "11-15-2017, 12:13 PM", "post": "G'day again everyone, Dispute?

I must have missed my post that I was trying to take away someone's, actually anyone's, rights? Could you point me in the right direction of that one please? Making those weapons illegal? Is that even possible in your country? I guess that is up to the judges..I think there is a difference between regulation based on circumstantial requirement, and the complete banning based on Government tyranny and oppression. Like I pointed out previously, I have no control, and will never have control of or over the Australian Government. I also subject to the laws of the land as assigned by the Australian Government....and I advocate \"Weapon regulation\", not \"Weapon bans\". Semi-automatic and fully automatic weapons were invented and mass produced well after the US Constitution was written up, as were chemical weapons and nuclear missiles, but you do have the right to bear arms in accordance with the US Constitution. Just like North Korea I guess. North Korea has the right to defend itself you know, I learned that one from Benjamen Netinyau. The Palestinians also have the right to defend themselves, but I cannot find a map whereby I can locate them anymore....The Palestinians have semi-automatic weapons I do believe. I also know that we have 1 tenth of your population in the states, but Australia is completely surrounded by water. Has Donald Trump built that wall yet?...and will the wall be built before his term of office is finished?....and will the next US President carry on the same edict?

I think The South should've been more patient and less paranoid about President Lincoln. I personally think that The U.S.A. could've preserved or maintained its eugenics policies, if it weren't for Nazi Germany's blunders. The Nazis should've been less aggressive on taking their lost lands back (from WW1/Versailles Treaty). https://www.quora.com/Why-was-it-bad...Kyran-Pender-1 It's a well-known fact, however, that The U.S.A. was the inspiration for eugenics policies. http://youtu.be/Y1PE-oxlrpk http:// youtu . be / Y1PE-oxlrpk http://youtu.be/kZmvD6xyVso http:// youtu . be / kZmvD6xyVso http://youtu.be/IaH0Ws8RtSc http:// youtu . be / IaH0Ws8RtSc ... it's just that The U.S.A. would've continued those policies, uninterrupted, if Nazis had \"behaved\" themselves ... but world war happened, followed by \"white guilt\" ... and eugenics just went into hiding for several decades. Eugenics is back again, but wearing a scientific good hat instead of a bad hat, this time around. As of the time I am typing this (November 2017), I know of four countries that are dealing with bio-/genetic-engineering and/or cloning. They are: The U.S.A., The U.K., South Korea, and China. South Korea has a dog-cloning facility, China has been bio-/genetic-engineering since their 2015 non-viable embryo experiment, and The U.K. now allows three-parent babies in order to avoid mitochondrial disorders. That's not all, but I'm not going to type everything when you could just use Google or YouTube. The West is generally slow-to-adopt due to ethics/morals, but they understand that The East is moving forward, no matter what, and it is in The West's best interests to keep-up with the pace. China is less-hindered by human rights violations and ethics/morals. The leaders of the Chinese communist party each have some sort of engineering degree, so they see things differently. The leaders of The West generally come from military backgrounds but mostly are Juris Doctorates ... having graduate degrees in law. There are groups of longevity-enthusiasts and bio-/genetic-engineers in The U.S.A., but there aren't many, and they seem to be small or underground. I only personally know of Dr. J. Craig Venter and the Google founders. http://youtu.be/3E25jgPgmzk http:// youtu . be / 3E25jgPgmzk https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calico_(company ) Dr. J.

Just to mention some of the situations that have contributed to the current decline of White civilization - * Changing of laws to accommodate non-White people inclusion into White nations. * Corruption of White Government policy makers. * Non-White influenced Government policies advocating non-white inclusion into White nations. * Removal of White racial education to accommodate non-white inclusion into White nations. * Government and Mass media promotion of \"Positive Discrimination\" in favour of non-Whites at the expense of White people. * Erosion of White Religious faiths in White nations. * Promotions of non-White religious faiths in White nations. * Lower White birth rates in White nations. * Widespread miscegenation by White people. * The promotion of White women into the workforce instead of Childbearing. * Liberalized immigration policies from Jewish influence to maintain their presence in White nations. * World wide Human displacement into White countries because of modern wars. * Removal of White Nationalist literature from libraries. * Removal of positive White history literature from Education facilities. * Education facilities being protective shrines for Communist ideology and Socialist ideology, instead of promoting the cross examination of all ideologies. * Education facilities rejecting and persecuting Racial Nationalist ideology and Racial Patriotic ideology, instead of promoting the cross examination of all ideologies. * Worldwide death rates of White people from modern wars. * Mass media outlets promoting the many destructive Liberalized and Zionist policies that favour non-White people in White Nations. * Mass media outlets disseminating misinformation. * The disruptions of the traditional White family unit due to reasons such as drug abuse, alcohol abuse, adultery, children born outside of wedlock, marriage failure, disputes over racial political adherency, and other things like these. * Criminal White people being used for anti-White Nationalist propaganda by Mass media and corrupt White Government policy makers. * White guilt attributed to all White people for historical events that simply did not occur and/or are grossly over inflated and/or had nothing to do with the White populous of the time period. * Inclusion of non-Whites into traditionally White militaries and traditionally White Governments. * White people regurgitating the propaganda produced by Mass media outlets and corrupt White Government policy makers without cross examining the information, and then not informing others of the truthful at every opportunity. E.G. Workers sitting there at \"smoko\" and one says \"I heard on the radio yesterday that the Nazis White Supremacists completely incinerate human bodies in the ground with petrol!!\" and no informed White people listening retorting with facts and information like \"Sure, let's go burn a dead pig in the ground and see how we go using petrol!!\", but in the same mannerisms that posters use on Stormfront - No Profanity, No Racial Epithets, etcetera..... * White Nationalists and White National Socialist viciously bickering over trivial finer points of White Government policies and thus dividing White people further.
