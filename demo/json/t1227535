Before then, I was somewhat politically apathetic, and didn't pay very close attention to the politics of my own country of Canada, let alone the politics of countries overseas. It prompted me to look further into the mass immigration issue, and the footage I witnessed, the accounts I read, the crime statistics, the demographics and birth rates, all utterly shocked and saddened me. I had no idea Europe had fallen so low and at such a hastened rate, especially Sweden, which was a country I thought about visiting one day, along with Italy, Germany, and France, all of which are seeing dark times currently, and darker times ahead. Britain is a low priority in terms of places I wanted to visit, as I've known how much of a corrupt nanny state it's become for a long time, but seeing how Islamized it is, the hatred spewed toward its native citizens by ungrateful immigrants, coupled with the weak capitulation and guilt by most Brits genuinely upsets me on a deep level. I wondered just how stupid politicians have to be to allow this to happen, to let blind paternalism toward third worlders take precedence over the preservation, protection and maintenance of a high civilization such as that of Europe and its people. Then as I read further into it, I started thinking that no... this is probably by design, and there is plan being set in motion. Politicians are not stupid. They attain their positions through careful calculation and manipulation of the masses, and they also answer not to the citizens, but to special interests that fund their campaigns. I've known governments were at least somewhat corrupt for a long time, but I had no idea they could be to this extent, to the point of being a very real threat to the native populations of an entire continent. At the point of fully digesting all of this, I was a blank slate in terms of my political leanings. My entire worldview was shattered and so I was willing to read or listen to anything right wing just to make sense of the new information, which the left was, and is continually failing on with its endless capitulation to, and apologetics for Islam, as well as its promotion of reality-divorced cultural Marxist ideology.

I was a diehard leftist for years, from middle school through early college. I would wake up, watch CNN during breakfast, print off articles from Mother Jones, Move On, and other leftist websites back then to read during my breaks between classes, come home and watch more leftist propaganda, and finish my day reading the works of Michael Moore, Al Franken, and Noam Chomsky. I began noticing some cognitive dissonance when I was in high school, as well as some lack of relevance in the movement; I asked myself why so many of my \"comrades\" were concerned with promoting homosexuality, transgenderism, and other sexual and lifestyle deviations, when my primary concern was economics. What did these things have to do with taking down \"evil\" capitalism? Then I entered college at a relatively well-known liberal arts school in Oregon, and the cognitive dissonance hit me full-on. Probably the biggest moment for me was the first election debate leading up to the 2008 presidential election. My school broadcast the debate in our largest auditorium for the students, and, of course, EVERY student there supported Obama. What got my attention, and what caused me to look into real history, was the fact that during the debate, the ONLY time both candidates looked directly into the camera was to express their unconditional support for the nation that calls itself Israel. I remember thinking to myself at that moment, \"what on earth does that have to do with American success? Why is this the ONLY question on which both candidates directly addressed the cameras?\" By my second year there, I had repudiated ALL of my previous ideologies and become a supporter of what today is labeled the \"alt-right,\" but which I see as simple common-sense support of American interests.
