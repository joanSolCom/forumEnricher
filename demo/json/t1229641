Normally there are debates about this always because Americans were normally not well informed about Romania and confused the gypsy population with the white population. It did not help that the term \"Romany\" was coined from Romania, but THAT term to describe gypsies is very inaccurate (just as calling them gypsies is inaccurate). What White Nationalists should know about gypsies (European WN probably already are familiar with this) is that even if a gypsy lives in a country, he doesn't belong to it, he lives outside of their laws and is itinerant. There's an indian population that claims gypsies as their own but I forget the name of it right now. Whiteuser1 should not use google images and his own ideas as a crash course in Romania. There are a few things going on in the background of Romania. The reason they are dark is because they have a large portion of Roman ancestry.

You have explained the best what the word Aryan implies. I am very busy nowadays, but this stupid question forced me to get into this debate. Now I will explain in detail where the denomination Aryan came from and that way we will know the history of it. Hopefully all the confusion will be eliminated. There were two waves of Aryans . The first Aryans were the bunch of White Race people who under the leadership of Baccus/Vaccus also called Ioan by Romans and Dyonisos by Greeks, colonized India. That happened about 6000 years before Alexander the Great went to India (according to Pliny the Elder). They were called ARYANS, because they were the people of RA or ARA who was the sun and their God. In Sanskrit SURIA means \"sun\", in Romanian is SOARE. Notice how close those words are. Chinese called them RI or RE people and the later Chinese who were not White Race anymore referred to them as LI people, because they could not pronounce the letter R. The second wave of Aryans were the Goths (Romanian ancestors) who were actually called Gete/Gatae by the Greeks and Romans, but the Germans called them Goths and that name stuck from third century AD on. The name Aryans to these people came in this manner. After Constantine the Great legalized Christianity in the Roman Empire, almost immediately an immense division came over the Christians. The Christian world was divided between the opinion of two leading Christians. One was a Bishop from Alexandria named Alexander, and the other was an Elder (Presbyter, PREZBIT means \"old Person\" in some Romanian dialect) named Arius, who was a Goth. Alexander believed in the Immaculate Conception and therefore believing that Jesus was the son of God from Conception. Arius on the other hand believed that Jesus was born a simple man, but become the Son Of God at the moment he was Baptized by John in the Jordan. Therefore Arians who were called that way after their leader, believed that Jesus was adopted by God as his son. The division was so great that the very existence of Christianity was threatened. A religious war was was in the making. But it was the wisdom of Constantine that stopped that disaster. Constantine invoked the first SYNOD and the greatest of all synods (SE-NOD means \"to tie a knot\" in Romanian, hence the word) at Niceia in Asia Minor. A very large building was constructed for that purpose. The Emperor paid all the expenses for all the Bishop's from all over the Empire to get to that Synod. Of course the Presbyters (Elders) from the Goths above Danube who were Aryans came as well. All the Christians had the right to be at that Synod. The territory above Danube was not Roman anymore after Aurelian in the year 270 AD. At that Synod were voted many issues, but the single most important was the vote to decide if the Christians will vote for the Immaculate Concepcion, or Adoption of Jesus. The Immaculate Conception won, but not with a great majority. Nevertheless Constantine ordered that from that moment on all Christians in the Roman Empire will accept the Immaculate Conception. Off course all the churches in the Roman Empire obeyed that law, but the Goths north of Danube didn't have to obey that law. And they didn't. They stayed Arians and when they went West and conquered Italy, Spain, Portugal and part of France and England, they imposed their language and their Arian religion there. Little by little the Catholic monks advancing in those countries, changed the thinking and I think it was Spain who was the last to convert to Catholicism when the Catholic Kings defeated the Moors. This explanation which is 100% true didn't come from any famous university professor, or from one single source of the antiquity books I studied, but it came about from bits and pieces I put together from many of those books. That is why you readers never heard this explanation before. As for Romanians being Aryans or not,sims to me the most ridiculous question. Both the first and the second wave of Aryans started from Romanian territory and spoke the language the Romanians speak today. That is the reason Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and \"the Latin\" part of English is much closer to Romanian than Latin. It is because Romania has the highest number of Gypsies and most Gypsies are in large cities that false impression exists. Of course Gypsies do not work and they are constantly on the streets of the cities. That gives the impression to people visiting Romania that Romanians are darker skin and black hair, because that is what one sees during the day on the streets of Bucharest. Most Romanians are Brown hair and Blue or Brown eyes. Some mixture with Gypsies took place, but not much. Hardly any mixture with the Gypsies existed before communism took over. It was during communist times when some mixture took place, because exactly the same policy and propaganda that exists in America today was applied.

Some people use the word Aryan when referring to any Whites. To others, only people of Germanic ancestry are Aryans. And some would say that any White person of noble character is an Aryan. But to me they are Aryans. Someone posted pics of Antonia Iacobescu earlier in this thread. I absolutely love her!

Great advice there on finding love. Not. If I'd done that I'd never have gotten a single date in my lifetime. BTW I'm not single. Just sayin....Romanian, Hungarian, and Czech women are the most beautiful to my eye and I wish there was a way those gals who would like to come to the US could meet upstanding American white men. I haven't had kids yet and am not married. I'd love to meet east euro gals and have gorgeous and strong white children. I'm too old to travel say for a career or the military and thus that is why I mentioned wishing there was a non romance scam way to meet those typesky of women who I'm most fascinated by. Perhaps I'm just daydreaming. How is that wrong to say or want to do? If you arent willfully living your life and trying to master your environment and have positive outcomes with others how will you ever get what you want and achieve what we need as a race? Apathy and pacifism in mating matters is for losers. Your suggestion is well intentioned and appreciated though.

Check the language maps and you'll see that the spread of the Semitic languages are a perfect match for the spread of E1b1b. Arabs, despite speaking a Semitic language, are not predominantly Semitic. The Ottoman empire drafted from North Africa. The Roman empire imported large numbers of slaves from North Africa as well. Jews are another source. E1b1b entered North Africa from the Horn of Africa about 13,000 years ago. It may have entered Europe from the Middle East 7,000 years ago, but obviously it came in later migrations as well.
