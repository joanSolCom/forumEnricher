  <raw><![CDATA[I'm tired, my friend. Not just in a physical sense, but a mental one as well. As I've said many other times, I'm not an intellectual giant, I'm not a professor with a passion for educating, and I'm not laser focused on a particular message or mission (at least not in the way that most people would understand). As far as what we consider group think of Jews......I've already touched on it. It's just common sense (which isn't common any more). A nation (society, empire, whatever) has no natural right to continue to exist. In fact, quite the opposite. Throughout history, it is demonstrably true that nations and societies fall apart when they stop being homogoneous (racially) and drastically change/transform into something "else" when they stop being homogoneous (ethnically). When a nation stops viewing itself as unique, as better than what else is out there......then is it any wonder why it then fundamentally transforms and becomes everything else that's already out there? If it isn't better, why defend it? Why remain different? This is what happens when a nation stops teaching its history, acknowledging and preserving its heritage, its ideals that made it different, special, better. It's the same thing with people. When a group of people ceases to see a difference between them and everyone else......then there is nothing to preserve, because they never realized there was anything to preserve in the first place. Judaism has played a special role in preserving the jews. Whether a jew practices religion or not, the Talmud is not only their religious text, but also their history, their heritage, the connection to their past and what made them a "special and uniuqe snowflake" in the world. Add to this the self centered teachings (God's Chosen) and the "Us vs Them" victimization, it creates a strong connection for the entire people to their "roots". It even declares who and how a person is racially a jew (born to a jewish mother). It creates a strong link to their past as a group that manifests itself in what can be described as "nationalistic exceptionalism". If the jews were not spread across the world, but lived almost without exception within the borders of their own land, they would be viewed and understood much differently. They would be seen simply as a strong, nationalistic people. It's the lack of borders coupled with their willingness.....near obsession......to live in nations that are not their own that confuses us. We forget that the jews see the entire world, all of creation, as their inheritance......not just their own little slice of the pie. Add to that near systemic narcissism based in their religious teachings (and thus their history), severe lack of morals when dealing with the goy (they are nothing but beasts of burden to serve the jew), systemic racial/religious superiority complex, and individual narcissistic tendencies......it becomes something that is difficult to comprehend. Especially since we, as Whites, live in societies that not only have forgotten what made us great, what separated us from the rest of the world, but actively teach and promote the antithesis of such. As an example of the social decay of the west, social solipsism is pervase in western society. It manifests itself in the clash of cultures we see with Islam. How any sane person can think that muslilms are the same as us.....that their religious teachings and beliefs are compatable with western society's beliefs and ideals is absolutely mind boggling to me. It is beyond self evident, and blatently spelled out in Islamic teachings. And yet, our cultural leaders (and thus, the average person) do not see them as different than us (they actually believe this) because of their "enlightenment". Luckily, it appears that the recent, undeniable failure of "integration" of muzzies into our societies is becoming so apparent, people are starting to wake up to the idea that they are not like us at all. And once people start realizing "that group over there is different from us", it's not a far stretch to become "we are different than those groups over there, there, and there". Believing *someone else* is different than us is the first step to realizing that *we* are different. The two statements, while very similar, have quite different implications. Anyways, I'm completely rambling now and going off on a tangent. Does jewish society have a group think? Not in the same way that we immediately think. It just comes down to their unique union of religious teachings being their history through which a strong connection to their past results. It promotes, undeniably, a separation between the jew and the goy. And it manifests itself in some strange, often seemingly conflicting ways (such as how does being superior and yet the constant victim mesh?). Again, to a narcissist, using constant victimization as a tool to get ahead is nothing but an effective strategy that befuddles the normal mind because it seems to be at odds.]]></raw>
