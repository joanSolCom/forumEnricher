  <raw><![CDATA[You asked me to reply to this thread, Gilamut, but you may be sorry you did. Let's start by telling the Solipsists they need to first define exactly what they mean by "self" before they start telling us all it's the only thing known to exist. Solipsism violates the laws of thermodynamics and if they want to tell me I made all that up, they can explain to me why everything else in my "self-universe" obeys it. I view the world through the lens of a logician, and I must assert (though you might call it narcissism) that there is no other valid lens through which to view it. Since logic is the process by which we evaluate relationships between conceptual events for connections, there cannot be any alternative to logic because logic must be used to evaluate or even compose any alternative method. Logic is all. That being the case, the universe isn't wide open for assorted worldviews: there is one correct view and all others are illogical and therefore contradict themselves. That's not narcissism; it's called reality. My opponents aren't wrong because I disagree with them. They are wrong because my conclusions are self-consistent with respect to probabilistic logic while theirs aren't. I do indeed run into people who have reached vastly different conclusions than I have and it usually turns out to be because they are stupid. Too arrogant? You sound to me like you are carefully trying to avoid saying the same thing, but I suspect you have experienced it even if you won't say it. My opinions change over the course of time, making me more right as the years go by, which makes me ever harder to defeat in an argument, and susceptible to turning out incorrect ever more rarely. Liberals think opinions just keep changing and aren't right or wrong. That's because they don't have any rules to guide them in rejecting false ideas as their understanding of the world mutates. I don't have any problem admitting it when I'm wrong. For God's sake, that's how I got into White Nationalism. Do you know who can't admit they are wrong? people who don't care about truth! And why don't they care about truth? because they are stupid!!! That's really all there is to it. Sounds smug, but we have the record in Opposing Views to demonstrate our point. We happen to hold a set of opinions that correspond to what we measure in the objective universe. That is one hell of a coincidence if it isn't actually truth. We need to be LESS like the Jews, not more, if we want to win this. The Jews aren't tribal, only selfish. They don't actually care about each other. They simply know their fellow cheaters and therefore form temporary alliances for personal gain. And when there is no gain to be had doing that anymore, they turn on each other in an instant. I was challenged about this idea here months ago and really started digging for examples of it. The world is overflowing with examples of it: Oppenheimer versus Teller, the fight over SOPA, every presidential election for the last forty years. They care about the tribe exactly as much as they care about Blacks: "Is it beneficial to me personally?" The Jewish strategy is stupid because Jews are stupid. They are like the guy who takes out twenty credit cards and maxes them out so he can have all sorts of nice things that fools look upon with jealousy and a total inability to foresee long-term consequences. I can foresee the long-term consequences to the Jews for what they are doing right now and I don't often write about them here because it would freak people out. They have made the ultimate deal with the devil and he will come to collect. Having an altruistic worldview is the (inevitable) capacity of a superior mind. You can call it narcissistic if you want to, but it follows from logic: They ways I screw over the world DO come back around to me. To idiots, it seems like magic. To a smart person, it's basically just societal economics. The Jews have a house of cards stacked so high right now that the collapse is unavoidable, and when it happens, it will spread to everything they have. Nothing will escape it. It's almost funny trying to guess what's going to give out first. Every one of them has built upon the mast of Holocaust pity, the beam of multiculturalism, the truss of liberal academia, and so on. Those are all tied together and will all fall in a cascade. There will be literally nowhere for them to run. This is a strategy? This is something we should emulate? The White Nationalist view should be one of decentralization: Such total individual strength and independence that all the world can fall into darkness and the best of us will still be standing, still smiling. It's why we don't get along with liberals: their philosophy is one of complete neediness, and who cares about the cost! You tell me, are these equally valid ideologies, or is one of them inherently doomed? Hint: It's not the one that simply cannot be killed unless you hunt down and murder every last person who adheres to it on the face of the earth. That's why we are still here after all their efforts to get rid of us, isn't it. If Jews really did have such an advanced trait as loyalty, I would agree with you that it is laudable. We DO have that trait already, and they do not. Never assume a herd of animals stays together because of empathy. Every last one of them is hoping when the predator comes, it will pick one of the others in the crowd. What do you call a flock of creatures that stay together to try to dump their problems on each other? I propose the name LEFTISTS.]]></raw>
